## 1. Progress Log

**Developer Name**: [Junjie Lyu]

### [Dec 15. 2023]

- **Time Spent:** 7hours
- **Tasks Completed:**
  - Decode https encrypted LINE traffic with Chrome add-on version
  - Locate LINE chat history db at _/data/data/jp.naver.line.android/databases/naver_line/chat_history_
- **Issues Encountered:**
  - LINE uses ssl pinning on all client applications making it impossible to bypass certificate verification without reverse-engineering the application
  - LINE uses letter Sealing (basically ECDH_WITH_AES_256_CBC) to double encrypt end-to-end traffics, making it impossible to decode the message only with the shared public keys
  - _chat_history_ section only includes texts, for other types of messages it appears to be empty or â–¡
- **Solutions and Workarounds:**
  - Using Chrome add-on LINE could bypass ssl pinning
  - Locating secret keys could theoretically help decoding the message after letter sealing
  - Chat history could be easily accessed in the db
- **Next Steps:**
  - Find where pictures are stored
  - Access the db on a rooted Android VM from host machine
- Additional Notes
  - Null
